Fifteen minutes later, police called an ambulance. Mike was unarmed and cops found no gun, but they found another man a few blocks away who was carrying a gun. They questioned and released him. Mikeâ€™s sister went to the San Francisco Office of Citizens Complaints and worked closely with them for awhile, but they suddenly cut off all communications with her after she gave them information on several witnesses. The family has filed a lawsuit against the city. Mike was well loved in the community. A spontaneous outpouring of grief and anger created a memorial alter of flowers, cards, signs and stuffed animals at the site where he was murdered. Mike was working for Goodwill Industries collecting furniture and donations, a job he had held since getting out of jail. Friends said Mike had a good heart. One young woman said that her mother considered him one of her own, that they had long talks about life and what he wanted to do with his. Mike left behind a 12-year-old daughter, who had just started to receive the fatherly attention she had missed while her dad was in jail.

He had a history of mental problems and tangles with the law dating to 1984. ``We don't understand what went on,'' said Netsanet Abraha, 17, his youngest sister, in a telephone interview. ``We don't have any answers. It's been really confusing.'' She added that the family was upset with media speculation about her brother's motives and mental state.

Abraha was fatally shot Tuesday morning inside the Bank of America branch at Powell and Market streets by eight officers, who fired dozens of bullets after Abraha appeared to pull the pin on a hand grenade and throw it at police.

George Hughes, a San Francisco SPCA volunteer who was outside the bank when the gunfire began, looked inside the window and described the scene as ``all hell breaking loose.'' ``I heard 40 to 50 shots within about three minutes,'' Hughes said. ``It reminded me of a John Wayne movie.''

The videos spread widely, triggering protests and a fiery town hall meeting. The first two videos were used by San Francisco Chief of Police Greg Suhr to claim his officers were justified in the firing of the large number of rounds at a man with a knife threatening to attack an officer. A third video released later clearly shows that Mario was not lunging at officers or otherwise posing a threat when he was shot down. His arms were at his sides.
