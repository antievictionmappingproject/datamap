While Police alleged that he was reaching for a weapon when he was shot, witnesses say he had his hands up and in plain view when he got out of the car. Police also say that a weapon was found in the car.  Apparently this weapon was found hours later. \n\nThe events that led to Boyd's death began when a woman flagged down police at the corner of Eddy and Laguna streets and said a man with a gun in a black SUV had tried to kidnap her.\n\nOfficers spotted Boyd's rented Chevy Blazer nearby and followed him. Paine was driving an unmarked police car, and as Boyd sped down Turk Street,  Paine fired a shot after another officer involved in the chase said Boyd had shot at him.\n\nThe Office of Citizen Complaints said Paine had no justification for firing because there was \"no objective evidence\" to show that anyone was in imminent danger, or that officers had exhausted all reasonable means of apprehension.\n\nOnce the chase ended on Larch Way outside the Plaza East public housing project, O'Malley yelled at Boyd to put his hands up, the charges said. O'Malley then fired, and other officers, hearing the shots, fired as well.","cartodb_id":1505,"created_at":"2014-09-03T22:53:31Z","updated_at":"2015-01-05T19:12:29Z","cartodb_georef_status":true,"race":"Black","photo":"http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/10/27/66/2194851/9/920x920.jpg","link":"https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2004/05/08/20702.php"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.39414,37.732745]},"properties":{"date":"2006-08-23T16:18:39Z","year":"2006","name":"Breed, Charles, 33","state":"California","city":"San Francisco","description":"A homicide suspect opened fire on two San Francisco police officers on Sunday night, sending at least six rounds into the officers’ car before one of the officers shot him dead, police reported Monday.\n\nCharles Breed, 33, worked with an accomplice, whom police later arrested, allegedly to kill two people at 10:10 p.m., police spokesman Neville Gittens said Monday.

The ambulance called to the scene was diverted to a non-injury accident and Mark was hog-tied, thrown into the back of the police van like a sack of potatoes and left face down to die. The three-minute ride to the nearest hospital took the police ten minutes. Mark died of a massive heart attack. The family and community waged a tenacious struggle for justice in forums, on the streets and in the courts. The Office of Citizen Complaints found the officers involved in the brutality that led to Mark’s death guilty of several violations.

Both of the roommates are facing an eviction at the end of the month. Their version differed sharply from the official version which casts López-Pérez as allegedly attempting to steal a bicycle with a knife when two plainclothes officers came on the scene at 9:45 p.m. The alleged victim thanked police for saving his life, police reported on the night of the incident.\nHowever, neighbors and eye witnesses  assert that police walked into a crime in progress and confused López-Pérez as a suspect, when in fact he was the victim.  The witnesses said that the cyclist stole López-Pérez’s cell phone and he was chasing after him.\nOne of the eyewitnesses offered more details at Saturday’s vigil.  “The cops came from behind him,” he said. “He didn’t realize they were cops. He squirmed away and ran towards the two (parked) cars.

Gibson, a veteran, was allegedly suffering from PTSD and brain cancer and was disoriented when he struck a police cruiser with his car. Officers boxed him in with their vehicles, commanding Gibson to exit his vehicle as he continued to attempt to drive away. Police reportedly made a plan to break Gibson's window with a beanbag round and use pepper spray to force him out. When the beanbag round was fired, Arevalo fired seven rounds of live ammunition at Gibson, who was unarmed. In October 2012, the Clark County District Attorney's office announced an indictment against Arevalo and is seeking a grand jury hearing of the case.[11] In May 2013, following an internal review, the Critical Incident Review Board recommended the termination of Arevalo's position with the Metro Police.[12]","cartodb_id":1101,"created_at":"2014-08-26T16:25:26Z","updated_at":"2014-08-28T03:21:09Z","cartodb_georef_status":true,"race":null,"photo":null,"link":null}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.988,33.95258]},"properties":{"date":"2012-04-26T00:00:00Z","year":"2012","name":"Clark, James (32)","state":"Georgia ","city":"Lawrenceville","description":"Clark was shot in his driveway following a 911 call that brought officers to the home.
